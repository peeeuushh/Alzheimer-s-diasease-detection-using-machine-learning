Overview
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. This application uses deep learning to analyze MRI images of the brain and detect the presence and severity of Alzheimer's disease.

The application can classify an uploaded MRI image into one of the following categories:

No Alzheimer
Very Mild Alzheimer
Mild Alzheimer
Severe Alzheimer
This helps doctors make informed decisions and start appropriate treatment as early as possible.

Features
Upload MRI brain images for analysis.
Predict the presence and stage of Alzheimer’s disease (if any).
Early detection for better management and treatment.
How It Works
Upload MRI Image: The user uploads an MRI image of the brain.
Prediction: The image is processed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that has been trained to detect different stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
Result: The application predicts whether the patient has Alzheimer's and, if so, at what stage (No Alzheimer, Very Mild, Mild, or Severe).
Output: The stage of Alzheimer’s is displayed as a result.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Frameworks: Flask/Django (optional, depending on what you've used)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Processing: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
Model Training: TensorFlow, Keras
Dataset
The model is trained using a dataset of MRI brain images from patients at various stages of Alzheimer's disease. The dataset contains images classified into four categories based on the severity of the disease.
